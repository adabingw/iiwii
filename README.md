# middle-class text editor
it is what it is (iiwii, pronounced ee-wee), is a middle-class text editor (as in, rich text editor, but not as rich, so middle class). 
the name comes from a derivation of what you see is what you get (wysiwyg), both being a mouthful and meaning "it literally is what is shown up there".

it also signifies an important way of thinking: the past is the past, focus on the present, prepare for the future (mostly in the context of exams)
